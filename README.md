# Pong with CooCox CoOS
Developed by Ainhoa Havelka and Pablo San Jos√© Burgos for the subject "Real Time Operating Systems" of the MSc Embedded systems from the UPV/EHU.

## Project
The assigned task was to create an application that uses several systems of the STM32F030R8 Nucleo Board, while using the CooCox CoOS operating system. For that, we used:

- 2 ADCs to record the movement of two analog joysticks, used to control the rackets
- 2 GPIOs to record the clicks of the joysticks' push buttons
- 1 LCD
